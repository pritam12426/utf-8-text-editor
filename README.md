# Utf-8 Text Editor

Welcome! This booklet guides you in building a text editor in C.
The editor is based on antirez’s kilo, with some modifications. It’s around 1000 lines of C code in a single file, without dependencies. It includes basic features, syntax highlighting, and a search function.
The booklet contains 184 steps. Each step involves adding, changing, or removing a few lines of code. You can compile and run the program after most steps to see the changes immediately.
I explain each step in detail. Feel free to skip the explanations if you prefer. The goal is to build a text editor from scratch, learning along the way. Check the appendices for more information, including troubleshooting and help resources.
